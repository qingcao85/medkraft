1.3 2020

2.1 According to Leichtle et al, this study examined the effects of a revised rib fracture triage guideline that put less emphasis on patient age and number of fractured ribs on ICU admission rate and patient outcomes. The results showed that the ICU admission rate significantly decreased from 73% to 63% without compromising patient safety, and poor functional status rather than age and anatomy was the strongest predictor of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 
2.2 The main findings of this study were that a revised rib fracture triage guideline with less emphasis on the patient’s age and the number of fractured ribs safely lowered ICU admission rates, and poor functional status rather than age and anatomy was the strongest predictor of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 

3.1 The study included adult blunt trauma patients with at least 1 rib fracture admitted following the revised rib fracture triage guideline from July 2018 through March 2019 and the original triage guideline from January 2017 through June 2017. Categorical data were described as number and percentage (N, %) and compared using Chi- squared and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous data were expressed as median (25th/75th percentile) and compared using the Wilcoxon- Mann- Whitney test. Univariate followed by multivariate analyses were used to determine independent predictors of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 
3.2 The study did not include intubated patients upon arrival and those with concomitant severe traumatic brain injury or polytrauma mandating ICU admission regardless of rib fractures.

Answer:
According to Jean et al., 1999, the contribution of rib fractures to economic loss through respiratory disease in calves was investigated in a study conducted at a dairy farm in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Results showed that the survival rate of calves with rib fractures was significantly lower than that of control calves, and four out of five scanned or necropsied calves had pneumonia at the sites of rib fractures. The pneumonia may have been caused by the pulmonary contusion due to the fractured ribs, as well as aspiration of meconium or milk. These findings suggest that rib fractures can lead to severe respiratory diseases in calves and cause economic losses."

2.1: According to Park et al., this study evaluated the efficacy of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) compared to non-operative management in patients with severe, non-flail rib fractures. The primary outcome of interest was the change in pain scores from baseline to two weeks postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included changes in inspiratory strength, forced expiratory volume, quality of life, and respiratory disability. 
2.2: The primary outcome of this study was pain control at two week follow up. We found that SSRF, as compared to non-operative management, improved pain control at two week follow up for patients with ≥ 3 displaced fractures in the absence of flail chest. We also observed fewer pleural space complications in the operative group, as well as improved self-reported respiratory disability at two week follow up in the operative group. 

3.1: The study was designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Baseline characteristics were compared between the two groups using the t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. The primary outcome of interest was assessed using a mixed-effects model with random intercepts and slopes. Secondary outcomes were assessed using the same model as the primary outcome, with the addition of an interaction term between treatment group and time. 
3.2: The study was relatively small and the sample size was not powered to detect differences in outcomes such as NPS, PFTs, or QoL. The study was conducted at a limited number of centers, which may have impacted the generalizability of the results. The study was not designed to assess long-term outcomes, and thus the effect of SSRF on long-term respiratory disability and QoL remains unknown."

2.1: According to Chiu et al., this study aimed to determine the charges for surgical stabilization and rigid fixation (SSRF) versus medical management during index admission for rib fractures. The results of the study indicated that medical management was associated with decreased charge for the treatment of rib fractures, while concomitant scapular fracture, ISS per unit increase, the presence of concomitant long bone fracture, bilateral rib fractures, and Glasgow Coma Scale per unit decrease were all associated with increased charge.
2.2: The main findings of this study were that medical management was associated with decreased charge for the treatment of rib fractures, while concomitant scapular fracture, ISS per unit increase, the presence of concomitant long bone fracture, bilateral rib fractures, and Glasgow Coma Scale per unit decrease were all associated with increased charge.

3.1: The research methodology used in this study was a retrospective analysis of a heterogeneous cohort of rib fracture patients from a single institution.
3.2: The main limitations of this study were that it was a retrospective study, and therefore, selection bias may have been present; the data were obtained from a single institution, payer, year, and geographic region, and therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other settings.
3.3: Possible directions for future research include conducting prospective studies to further investigate the cost-effectiveness of SSRF versus medical management for rib fractures and to determine whether the results are generalizable to other settings."

2.1: According to Kao et al., this study investigated the association between surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) and mortality in elderly trauma patients. The study found that SSRF was associated with a decreased risk of mortality in trauma patients aged 80 years or older. However, SSRF was associated with an increased risk of secondary outcomes, such as pneumonia, longer length of stay, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. 
2.2: The main findings of this study were that SSRF was associated with a decreased risk of mortality in elderly trauma patients, but was associated with an increased risk of secondary outcomes. 

3.1: This study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective, observational study, and thus, causality cannot be determined. Second, the study was conducted at a single center, and thus, the results may not be generalizable to other centers. Third, the study was underpowered to detect differences in secondary outcomes, and thus, the results should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the study was unable to control for the indication for surgery, the type of surgery performed, the timing of surgery, the type of anesthesia used, and the type of rib fixation used, which may have been confounders."
