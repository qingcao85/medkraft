1.3 2020

2.1 According to Leichtle et al, this study examined the effects of a revised rib fracture triage guideline that put less emphasis on patient age and number of fractured ribs on ICU admission rate and patient outcomes. The results showed that the ICU admission rate significantly decreased from 73% to 63% without compromising patient safety, and poor functional status rather than age and anatomy was the strongest predictor of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 
2.2 The main findings of this study were that a revised rib fracture triage guideline with less emphasis on the patient’s age and the number of fractured ribs safely lowered ICU admission rates, and poor functional status rather than age and anatomy was the strongest predictor of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 

3.1 The study included adult blunt trauma patients with at least 1 rib fracture admitted following the revised rib fracture triage guideline from July 2018 through March 2019 and the original triage guideline from January 2017 through June 2017. Categorical data were described as number and percentage (N, %) and compared using Chi- squared and Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Continuous data were expressed as median (25th/75th percentile) and compared using the Wilcoxon- Mann- Whitney test. Univariate followed by multivariate analyses were used to determine independent predictors of complications and prolonged hospital stay. 
3.2 The study did not include intubated patients upon arrival and those with concomitant severe traumatic brain injury or polytrauma mandating ICU admission regardless of rib fractures.

Answer:
According to Jean et al., 1999, the contribution of rib fractures to economic loss through respiratory disease in calves was investigated in a study conducted at a dairy farm in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Results showed that the survival rate of calves with rib fractures was significantly lower than that of control calves, and four out of five scanned or necropsied calves had pneumonia at the sites of rib fractures. The pneumonia may have been caused by the pulmonary contusion due to the fractured ribs, as well as aspiration of meconium or milk. These findings suggest that rib fractures can lead to severe respiratory diseases in calves and cause economic losses."
