0.2, Author: Otaka et al.
0.3, Year:  2020
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: Rib fractures are common injuries in patients with blunt trauma, and can cause severe pain and respiratory compromise.1–3 Rib fixation is an effective treatment for rib fractures, and can reduce pain, improve pulmonary function, and prevent pulmonary complications.4–7 However, the optimal timing of rib fixation remains unclear. 
1.2, Methods: We used data from the Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database, which is a nationwide inpatient database in Japan. The DPC database includes data from approximately 1,000 hospitals nationwide, including both public and private hospitals. The database contains information on demographics, diagnoses, procedures, length of stay, and costs. 
1.3, Results: A total of 1,541 patients were included in the analysis. Early rib fixation was associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (percent difference, –33.3%; 95% CI, –43.9 to –22.3; p < 0.001), shorter length of hospital stay after rib fixation (percent difference, –29.6%; 95% CI, –40.2 to –18.7; p < 0.001), and lower total hospitalization costs (percent difference, –27.9%; 95% CI, –39.7 to –14.5; p < 0.001). There were no statistical differences in the incidence of pneumonia after admission (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4 to 1.7; p = 0.59) and all-cause 28-day in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0 to 1.7; p = 0.19) (early vs. late, respectively).

the detail of the article being 
emula.

1.1, Background: Rib fractures are a common injury that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly population. Diagnosis of rib fractures is typically made with radiographs, however, this modality is not always available in the ED. Ultrasound has been proposed as an alternative modality to diagnose rib fractures in the ED.

1.2, Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed during one session at a cadaver lab. Single rib fractures on each of rib five through eight were created by study staff. Four subjects, blinded to the normal versus fractured ribs, were asked to identify the presence of a fracture on each rib. The subjects were all emergency medicine residents with varying levels of ultrasound experience.

1.3, Results: The PPV and NPV were 55.17% and 54.29% respectively. This suggests that US may be useful in ruling out the presence of rib fractures, but may not be reliable in ruling in the presence of rib fractures.

1.4, Conclusion: In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that US may not be reliable in detecting rib fractures in cadaver models. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

2.1, Key words: Rib fractures, ultrasound, cadaver models, emergency medicine.

2.2, Limitations: This study had a small sample size and a limited population of sonographers.

2.3, Possible directions for future research: Future studies should include a larger sample size and a more diverse population of sonographers. Additionally, studies should include a comparison of US to other imaging modalities, such as CT or MRI, to determine the accuracy of US in detecting rib fractures in cadaver models.

1.1, Background: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to a Level 1 trauma center with rib fractures during a 4-year period.

1.2, Methods: Patients were excluded if no VC was performed within 48 hours of admission. Data collected included demographics, hospital/intensive care unit length of stay, epidural, discharge to home versus extended care facility, mortality, chest Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score, Injury Severity Score (ISS), number of rib fractures, hemothorax/pneumothorax, presence of pulmonary contusion, presence of chest tube, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and average daily VC (percentage of predicted). Statistical analysis was performed using W2 and multivariate logistic regression.

1.3, Results: Of 801 patients with rib fractures, 683 had VC performed within 48 hours. Average age was 53 years, median ISS was 13 (interquartile range, 9 Y18), and median length of stay was 5 days. Most (72%) were discharged home, and 26% went to extended care facility. Ten percent developed a pulmonary complication, and there were nine deaths. Every 10% increase in VC was associated with 36% decrease in likelihood of pulmonary complication. Patients with a VC greater than 50% had a significantly lower association of pulmonary complication (p= 0.017), and a VC of less than 30% was independently associated with pulmonary complication (odds ratio, 2.36).

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This study aimed to investigate the association between diminished bone mineral density (BMD) and rib fractures in patients aged 50 years or older who sustained substantial blunt thoracic trauma.

1.2, Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients aged 50 years or older who sustained substantial blunt thoracic trauma and were admitted to a trauma center in the Netherlands between January 2011 and December 2016. The study included patients with a BMD T-score of less than -2.5 and a control group with a BMD T-score of -2.5 or higher.

1.3, Results: The study found that patients with diminished BMD had a higher risk of sustaining rib fractures after substantial blunt thoracic trauma than patients with a normal BMD. However, the number and location of rib fractures between the two groups could not be proven.

1.4, Conclusion: These findings suggest that diminished BMD should be taken into account when assessing patients aged 50 years or older presenting to the hospital after substantial blunt thoracic trauma and that the presence of rib fractures should be investigated with appropriate diagnostic procedures.

0.2, Author: Shelley et al.
0.3, Year:  2016
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: Rib fractures are associated with an increased risk of pulmonary complications, ICU admissions, and mortality. Pain control in patients with multiple rib fractures is important to reduce the risk of adverse events. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the preferred method for pain control, but posterior paramedian subrhomboidal (PoPS) analgesia has been proposed as an alternative.

1.2, Methods: This prospective study was conducted at a level I trauma center from January 2013 to December 2014. Inclusion criteria included age ≥18 years and ≥3 acute rib fractures on chest radiograph. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, contraindication to neuraxial analgesia, and inability to provide informed consent. Patients were randomized to receive either TEA or PoPS analgesia.

1.3, Results: A total of 60 patients were included in the study, 30 in each group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographics, mechanism of injury, injury severity score, or number of rib fractures. There were no differences in the incidence of pulmonary complications, ICU admissions, or mortality between the two groups. There was a trend towards lower pain scores and decreased daily adjunct morphine equivalent use in the PoPS group compared to the TEA group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

1.4, Conclusion: PoPS analgesia is a safe and effective alternative to TEA for pain control in patients with multiple rib fractures.

0.2, Author: Rosenberg et al.
0.3, Year:  2015
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This research paper examines the mortality rate associated with rib fractures in pediatric patients. It hypothesizes that due to the pliability of younger ribs, pediatric ribs require more energy to fracture than adult ribs, resulting in a different rib fracture-associated pediatric mortality rate.

1.2, Methods: The study used data from the National Trauma Data Bank to analyze the mortality rate associated with rib fractures in pediatric patients. The data was collected from patients aged 0-17 years who were admitted to trauma centers between 2009 and 2014.

1.3, Results: The study found that the mean/median abdomen AIS score was 1.3/1, the mean/median extrathoracic AIS score was 1.2/1, and the mean/median number of ribs fractured was 0/0. The study also found that the incidence of flail chest was 0.3%, and that there was a statistically significant difference in mortality rate between pediatric and adult patients with rib fractures.

1.4, Conclusion: The study concluded that pediatric patients with rib fractures have a higher mortality rate than adult patients with rib fractures, likely due to the increased energy required to fracture pediatric ribs.

2.1, Key words: Pediatric, Rib Fractures, Mortality Rate, National Trauma Data Bank

2.2, Limitations: The study was limited by its reliance on data from the National Trauma Data Bank, which may not be representative of all pediatric rib fracture cases.

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This study aimed to compare in-hospital outcomes, costs, and charges for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) patients with a series of propensity-matched, nonoperatively managed rib fracture (NON-OP) patients at a single Level 1 trauma center.

1.2, Methods: The study used a retrospective cohort design to compare SSRF and NON-OP patients. The ZINB regression model was used to assess the relationship between SSRF and ICU length of stay (LOS) and ventilator days.

1.3, Results: SSRF was associated with a significantly shorter ICU LOS (p<0.001) and ventilator days (p<0.001). The SSRF group had lower total charges ($62,919; 95% CI $54,719–$71,119) and total costs ($45,717; 95% CI $38,917–$52,517) than the NON-OP group ($76,945; 95% CI $68,745–$85,145 and $54,852; 95% CI $47,652–$62,052, respectively). The difference in total charges and costs between the two groups was statistically significant (p<0.001).

1.4, Conclusion: SSRF is associated with improved in-hospital outcomes, decreased morbidity, and improved quality of life after discharge. The additional costs associated with SSRF must be weighed against the potential benefits.

1.1, Background: This paper examines the use of computed tomography (CT) to detect rib fractures in deceased children and its potential role in determining the cause of death in cases of sudden unexplained death in infancy.

1.2, Methods: The study included a retrospective review of medical records of 20 deceased children from a single institution. CT scans were performed on all 20 children and radiographs were performed on 15 of the children.

1.3, Results: Of the 20 children, CT scans revealed rib fractures in 11 children. Of the 11 children with rib fractures, seven had a diagnosis of physical abuse, four had a diagnosis of sudden infant death syndrome, two had a diagnosis of sepsis, and five had a diagnosis of undetermined cause.

1.4, Conclusion: The authors concluded that CT is more sensitive than radiography for the detection of rib fractures in deceased children, and that CT should be considered for the evaluation of rib fractures in cases of suspected physical abuse. This study is important for several reasons, as it provides evidence that CT can be used to detect rib fractures in cases of suspected physical abuse and to help determine the cause of death in cases of sudden unexplained death in infancy.

The randomization sequence was generated by a statistician and was concealed from the study team until the patient was enrolled. The study drug was administered as an intravenous infusion at a rate of 2 μg·kg−1·min−1for patients aged 65 to 74 years and 2 μg·kg−1·min−1for patients aged 75 years or older.

1.3, Results: Low-dose ketamine failed to decrease NPS within any of the patient groups and there was actually a lower NPS in the severely injured (ISS ≥15) placebo group at 48 hours. A significant reduction in OME was noted in severely injured patients receiving LDK, but only at the 12-hour to 24-hour time-frame. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups, nor were the rates of epidural placement.

1.4, Conclusion: Low-dose ketamine was not found to be effective in reducing NPS or OME in patients with rib fractures.

0.2, Author: Griffard et al.
0.3, Year:  2020
the detail of the article being 
1.1 Background: Rib fractures are a common injury in polytrauma patients and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of rib fractures is variable and often depends on the clinical judgement of the treating physician.

1.2 Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of our Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) database for patients aged 18 to 99 who underwent operative intervention of ribs from January 2016 to July 2019. We collected data on hospital length of stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) LOS, ventilator days, Injury Severity Score (ISS), age, discharge disposition and packed red blood cell transfusions.

1.3 Results: Between January 2016 and July 2019, 33 of 4189 total patients diagnosed with rib fractures underwent operative fixation; the matched non-operative group had a mean age of 55.7 years and a mean ISS of 16.5. The mean LOS was significantly longer in the operative group (13.2 days vs. 8.9 days, p < 0.001). The mean ICU LOS was also significantly longer in the operative group (7.3 days vs. 4.9 days, p < 0.001).

1.4 Conclusion: Operative intervention of rib fractures is associated with increased hospital and ICU length of stay compared to non-operative management.

2.1 Key words: Rib fractures, Polytrauma, Operative intervention, Non-operative management

2.2 Limitations: This study was limited by its retrospective design, which may have introduced selection bias. Additionally, the study was limited by its small sample size and lack of long-term follow-up.

0.2, Author: Kandiah et al.
0.3, Year:  2014
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This paper describes the use of a left T7 continuous paravertebral nerve block placed with ultrasound guidance for pain relief in an infant with respiratory failure from left 7th and 8th rib fractures and a pulmonary contusion of the left chest.

1.2, Methods: After a bolus of 0.5% ropivacaine, the patient's heart rate was monitored to assess block efficacy. Ventilatory support was reduced while the fentanyl infusion was tapered off over 12 hours. The infant's trachea was successfully extubated within 24 hours. In the absence of an increased need for IV analgesics, the PVNB catheter was removed.

1.3, Results: The patient's heart rate decreased from an average of 180 to 140 bpm 5 minutes after the bolus was administered, suggesting block efficacy. Ventilatory support was reduced while the fentanyl infusion was tapered off over 12 hours. The infant's trachea was successfully extubated within 24 hours. In the absence of an increased need for IV analgesics, the PVNB catheter was removed.

1.4, Conclusion: The use of ultrasound-guided paravertebral nerve blocks in pediatric patients with rib fractures and thoracic trauma is a safe and effective technique for providing analgesia.

2.1, Key words: Paravertebral nerve block, ultrasound guidance, pediatric patients, rib fractures, thoracic trauma, analgesia.

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This paper aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect fractures on computed tomography (CT) images.
1.2, Methods: The dataset used in this study consisted of 545 CT images from 545 patients, which was divided into a training dataset (n = 436) and a testing dataset (n = 109). The training process of the CNN model was divided into two stages. The model was trained using the training dataset and then fine-tuned using the validation dataset. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the detection time of the radiologists and the CNN model.
1.3, Results: The model achieved an average precision of 0.936, an average recall of 0.927, and an average F1-score of 0.931 in the first stage. In the second stage, the model achieved an average precision of 0.944, an average recall of 0.936, and an average F1-score of 0.939. The AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of model I/T were higher than those of model I (p<0.001). The detection accuracy of the model for healing and old fractures was better than that for fresh fractures.
1.4, Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that the developed CNN model can accurately detect fractures on CT images.

1.1, Background: Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses proton beams to deliver high-precision radiation to tumors, while sparing the surrounding normal tissues and organs. Recent studies have shown that proton therapy is as safe and effective as photon therapy for breast cancer.

1.2, Methods: We identified a total of 658 patients who received proton therapy for breast cancer. We used logistic regression to assess the association between rib fractures and RBE.

1.3, Results: We identified a total of 658 patients, of whom 48 (7.3%) had rib fractures. The median RBE at the distal edge of the proton beams was 1.4 (IQR 1.3-1.5). The RBE at the distal edge was significantly associated with rib fractures (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p=0.008). The risk of rib fractures increased by 30% for each 0.1 increase in RBE.

1.4, Conclusion: The increased RBE at the distal edge of proton beams may contribute to the increased rib fracture rate in patients receiving proton therapy for breast cancer.

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: Rib fractures are common injuries in trauma patients and they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pain is the main complaint of patients with rib fractures and it is usually severe and persistent. Therefore, multimodal analgesia is recommended for pain management in rib fractures. Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is a relatively new regional anesthesia technique that provides effective analgesia for the thoracic wall and the adjacent structures.

1.2, Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, single-center study was conducted at Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation between April 2019 and October 2019. A total of 60 patients with rib fractures were included in the study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the SAPB group (n = 30) and the control group (n = 30).

1.3, Results: The SAPB group had significantly lower pain scores at rest and during coughing at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after the block compared to the control group. The total analgesic consumption was significantly lower in the SAPB group than in the control group at 24 h after the block.

1.4, Conclusion: SAPB is an effective and safe technique for pain management in patients with rib fractures. It can reduce the total analgesic consumption and pain scores in these patients.

2.1, Key words: Serratus anterior plane block; Rib fracture; Analgesia; Multimodal analgesia; Pain management

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: The management of multiple rib fractures is controversial, and there is no consensus on the optimal treatment. Nonoperative management (NOM) is the most commonly used treatment, while some authors have suggested that surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) may be beneficial in certain cases.

1.2, Methods: Meta-analyses have demonstrated that SSRF results in faster recovery and lower long-term complication rates versus NOM. To evaluate postoperative outcomes for multiple rib fracture patients following SSRF versus NOM, we conducted a real-world, all-comer study design. We used FSW as a matching method to compare the two cohorts.

1.3, Results: The study included a total of 818 patients, with 409 in the SSRF group and 409 in the NOM group. The two cohorts were well balanced, as demonstrated by the standardized differences of less than 10%. The study found that SSRF was associated with a lower rate of complications, shorter hospital stays, and lower mortality rates compared to NOM.

1.4, Conclusion: Our study suggests that SSRF may be a beneficial treatment option for patients with multiple rib fractures, as it is associated with lower rates of complications, shorter hospital stays, and lower mortality rates compared to NOM.

2.1, Key words: Multiple rib fractures, Nonoperative management, Surgical stabilization of rib fractures, Postoperative outcomes.

2.2, Limitations: Most of the studies were conducted in specialized trauma centers and may not reflect the outcomes of patients treated in the general population.

the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: The traditional approach to treating sternal-shoulder-rib fractures (SSRFs) has been extrathoracic plating (ETP) with a thoracotomy or thoracoscopy. Recently, an intrathoracic approach (ITP) has been described as an alternative to ETP.

1.2, Methods: This study evaluated the effect of ITP on length of stay (LOS) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS compared with ETP in a single-center prospective observational paradigm shift study.

1.3, Results: The mean LOS and ICU LOS were similar between the ITP and ETP cohorts (17.7 vs 15.3 days, p=0.45; 8.2 vs 21.6 days, p=0.06, respectively). The use of neuraxial opiates was more common in the ETP cohort. The use of ITP was associated with increased hematothorax rates.

1.4, Conclusion: This study showed that ITP and ETP are associated with similar outcomes in the management of SSRFs. Further study is necessary to determine if the initial learning curve associated with ITP is associated with long-term outcomes that are superior to ETP.

1.1, Background: This research paper examines the gap between evidence and practice in the use of surgical site radiation therapy (SSRF). It surveys 30 institutional guidelines to assess the implementation of evidence-based SSRF recommendations.

1.2, Methods: The survey included 30 institutional guidelines from the United States, Canada, and Australia. The strength of the recommendations was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

1.3, Results: The survey found that only two of seven strong recommendations were reflected in a majority of institutional guidelines. There was no statistically significant association between the strength of recommendation and implementation within a majority of institutional guidelines. Most guidelines detailed SSRF indications but few specified contraindications or operative/postoperative management considerations.

1.4, Conclusion: The lack of implementation of strong recommendations may be attributed to several factors, including the lack of evidence to support the recommendation, the lack of consensus among clinicians, and the lack of resources to implement the recommendation. To bridge the gap between evidence and practice, there needs to be a concerted effort to develop and disseminate evidence-based SSRF guidelines and to ensure that providers are aware of and adhere to these guidelines.

2.1, Key words: Surgical Site Radiation Therapy, Evidence-based Guidelines, Practice Variation, Patient Outcomes, Cost Reduction.

1.3, Results: The median number of plates used per operation was 8 (IQR, 7–10). The median time per plate placed was 1.9 minutes (IQR, 1.6 –2.2 minutes). The median total operative time was 16 minutes (IQR, 14–20 minutes). There was no difference in total operative time between the three surgeons.

1.4, Conclusion: CUSUM analysis can be used to measure the learning curve of a new surgical technique. The CUSUM technique can be used to measure the learning curve of a new surgical technique, such as SSRF, and can be used to identify surgeons who have achieved a certain level of technical proficiency.

2.1, Key words: Surgical Stabilization of Rib Fractures, Learning Curve, Cumulative Sum, Intraoperative Duration

2.2, Limitations: This study is a single institution experience and may not be generalizable to other institutions. The sample size is small, and the number of operations performed by each surgeon is even smaller. The CUSUM technique is a measure of the average performance of a surgeon and does not account for individual variation.

2.3, Possible directions for future research: Future research should focus on larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to better understand the learning curve of SSRF operations and to identify which factors influence the learning curve. Additionally, further research should investigate the impact of individual variation

0.2, Author: Choi et al.
0.3, Year:  2020
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This study examines the quality of life of patients with traumatic rib fractures after discharge from hospital.
1.2, Methods: This study used a prospective cohort design to assess the quality of life of patients with traumatic rib fractures at a single center.
1.3, Results: The study found that patients with traumatic rib fractures experienced suboptimal short-term quality of life after discharge. Quality of life improved over time, but even 3 months after discharge, patients reported challenges performing activities of daily living and slower-than-expected recovery. Perception of injury severity had a large effect on quality of life.
1.4, Conclusion: Our findings suggest that efforts to improve quality of life should mirror efforts to reduce physical complications. Optimal care for patients with rib fractures, even those with isolated rib fractures, may require close postdischarge follow-up and screening for posttraumatic stress disorder.
2.1, Key words: Traumatic rib fractures, Quality of Life, Injury Severity, Postdischarge Follow-up.
2.2, Limitations: Our study population was predominantly male (80%) and white (91%), which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Second, our study was conducted at a single center, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Third, our study population had relatively low injury burden, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Fourth, we did not assess for posttraumatic stress disorder, which may have affected QoL. 
2.3, Possible directions for future research: Future research should focus on assessing the long-term quality of life of patients with traumatic rib fractures and exploring strategies to improve quality of life in this population.

0.1, Title: Spirometry not pain level predicts outcomes in geriatric patients with isolated rib fractures 
0.2, Author: Schuster et al.
0.3, Year:  2020
the detail of the article being 
1.1, Background: This study aimed to examine the association between percent-predicted FEV1 on admission and length of stay (LOS) in geriatric patients with isolated rib fractures.
2.1, Methods: Patients were screened for eligibility and those meeting the criteria were approached for consent. On initial evaluation, medical history, any underlying pulmonary disease, functional dependence, and smoking history were recorded. Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale, and use, type, and timing of analgesics were recorded. Hand grip strength was measured with a Baseline Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer, FVC and FEV1 were measured with the Spirobank II bedside spirometer, and NIF was measured with a negative pressure meter. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25.
1.3, Results: The primary outcome was the length of stay (LOS) in the hospital. Secondary outcomes included the number of days in the intensive care unit (ICU), transfer to a higher level of care, intubation, pneumonia, mortality, and readmission. The percentage of predicted values were then divided into quartiles, with quartile 1 representing the lowest 25% of predicted values and quartile 4 representing the highest 25% of predicted values. The primary outcome was compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.
1.4, Conclusion: This study suggests that percent-predicted FEV1 on admission is a predictor of both home discharge and LOS in geriatric patients with isolated rib fractures. Patients with a percent-predicted FEV1 greater than 60% can potentially be discharged home with a short LOS. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of other factors, such as social support, on the outcomes of these patients.
